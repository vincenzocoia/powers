__Note__: This package package is only meant for expository purposes -- although you might just find it handy!

Want to compute powers without having to use `^` or `**`? Give `sqrt` some friends by loading the `powers` package! 

```{r}
library(powers)
```

Want squares, cubes, or reciprocals? Easy.

```{r}
square(1:10)
cube(1:10)
reciprocal(1:10)
```

List-friendly inputs, as well:

```{r}
cube(list(1, 4, 5))
```
